   FOLONITE TRACK — ICP GUIDE
   Target: Private Engineering Colleges & Technical Institutes (India)
   Prepared for: Internal Sales & Onboarding Team
   Last Updated: February 2026
================================================================================

This document is a complete internal guide for targeting, pitching, selling,
and onboarding Private Engineering Colleges with Folonite Track. Every team
member involved in sales, onboarding, or customer success should read this
before engaging any college prospect.

================================================================================
PART 1: UNDERSTANDING THE CUSTOMER
================================================================================

WHO IS A PRIVATE ENGINEERING COLLEGE?
--------------------------------------
India has approximately 10,000 AICTE-approved private engineering colleges
and 4,500 polytechnic institutes. These are privately owned and operated
institutions — not IITs, NITs, or central government colleges.

They operate with:
  - 300 to 5,000 students
  - 8 to 30+ departments (CSE, Mechanical, Civil, ECE, EEE, etc.)
  - 1 to 3 campus buildings or multiple blocks
  - A Principal/Director at the top
  - HODs (Heads of Department) managing each department
  - A dedicated IQAC (Internal Quality Assurance Cell) team
  - A Finance/Accounts department managing budgets and procurement
  - Lab technicians/assistants managing equipment day-to-day

These colleges operate on a constrained annual budget, typically ₹2–₹15 crore
per year in operational expenses, with a portion allocated for infrastructure
and equipment.


WHAT ASSETS DOES A TYPICAL ENGINEERING COLLEGE MANAGE?
--------------------------------------------------------
Every engineering college has a large, diverse, and expensive asset base
spread across multiple physical locations. Here is a realistic breakdown:

COMPUTER LABS:
  - 200 to 1,500 desktop computers / workstations
  - Servers, networking switches, routers, UPS units
  - Monitors, peripherals, keyboards, webcams
  - Licensed software installed on each machine

SCIENCE & ENGINEERING LABS:
  - Oscilloscopes, function generators, multimeters (ECE/EEE)
  - CNC machines, lathes, welding equipment, drilling machines (Mech)
  - 3D printers, robotic arms, microcontroller kits (emerging labs)
  - Surveying instruments, theodolites, total stations (Civil)
  - Chemical equipment, spectrophotometers, distillation units (Chemistry)
  - Biology/pharmacy lab equipment (if applicable)

CLASSROOM & COMMON INFRASTRUCTURE:
  - Projectors and screens in each classroom
  - Smart boards / interactive displays
  - Air conditioning units across classrooms and labs
  - CCTV cameras and security infrastructure
  - PA systems and audio equipment

FURNITURE:
  - Desks and chairs across classrooms, labs, offices
  - Lab benches and stools
  - Office furniture (staff rooms, principal cabin, reception)

LIBRARY:
  - Computers at reading terminals
  - Printers, scanners, barcode readers
  - Server/NAS for digital library

TOTAL ROUGH ASSET COUNT (Mid-sized engineering college, 1,000 students):
  - Approximately 800 to 2,500 individual trackable assets
  - Spread across 6 to 20 distinct departments/labs


WHAT ARE THEIR BIGGEST PROBLEMS?
----------------------------------
Here are the problems they face every single day. These are not theoretical.
These are problems that HODs, lab technicians, and IQAC coordinators complain
about constantly. Understand these deeply before you talk to a prospect.

PROBLEM 1: "We don't know what we have."
  - No centralized asset register exists.
  - Each lab technician maintains a personal diary or Excel sheet.
  - The Principal cannot see college-wide asset data.
  - Equipment purchased 5 years ago is untraceable — no one knows if it exists.
  - Departments hoard assets; other departments buy duplicates because they
    don't know a working unit exists 2 floors away.

PROBLEM 2: "Our annual stock verification is a nightmare."
  - AICTE, UGC, and NAAC all require formal stock verification records.
  - Every year (or before every inspection), the admin team manually walks
    through every lab, cross-checking physical items against old registers.
  - This process takes 2 to 4 weeks, involves 10-20 staff members,
    produces paper-based stock verification reports that are inconsistent
    and easily disputed.
  - Equipment goes missing between the count and the submission of the report.
  - If NAAC inspectors ask for documentation, the college scrambles.

PROBLEM 3: "Equipment breaks and nobody fixes it on time."
  - There is no formal maintenance request system.
  - A broken oscilloscope means a lab technician calls the HOD,
    who calls the admin office, who calls a vendor — on WhatsApp.
  - No tracking of when the request was raised.
  - No accountability for who is responsible.
  - Expensive equipment stays broken for months.
  - AMC (Annual Maintenance Contract) renewals are missed because no one
    tracks expiry dates.

PROBLEM 4: "NAAC is coming and we are not ready."
  - NAAC assesses colleges on Criterion 4 (Infrastructure and Learning
    Resources) which directly requires asset documentation.
  - Colleges need to show asset utilization, maintenance records, and
    systematic stock verification.
  - The IQAC coordinator (the person responsible for NAAC documentation)
    is manually collecting spreadsheets from every HOD, compiling them,
    and creating a master document — this takes months.
  - NAAC now does e-inspections. Documents submitted digitally must be
    consistent, traceable, and audit-ready. Excel files don't cut it.

PROBLEM 5: "Equipment goes missing and no one is accountable."
  - High-value portable equipment (laptops, oscilloscopes, robotic kits)
    moves between labs, classrooms, and sometimes off-campus.
  - No tracking means no accountability.
  - Colleges lose ₹10–₹50 lakhs per year in untracked equipment.
  - When asked "who last used/moved this item?", there is no answer.

PROBLEM 6: "We have multiple buildings and no visibility."
  - Multi-block campuses have assets distributed across Block A, B, C,
    hostels, admin buildings, and sports facilities.
  - There is no single view across all locations.
  - Lab technicians in Block A don't know what assets exist in Block B.

================================================================================
PART 2: HOW FOLONITE TRACK SOLVES EACH PROBLEM
================================================================================

This section maps every problem above to one or more Folonite Track features,
with a clear explanation of how the feature works and what value it creates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM 1 SOLVED: "We don't know what we have."
FEATURE: Asset Registry + Department & Property Scoping
------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW IT WORKS:
  Every asset in the college is registered in Folonite Track's central
  Asset Registry. Each asset gets:
    - A unique Asset ID (auto-generated, e.g., ETLAB001, MECHLAB004)
    - A name, type, and description
    - Assignment to a specific Property (Block/Building) and Department (Lab)
    - Status: Active, Expiring Soon, Under Maintenance
    - Quantity (for consumables) or individual serial number
    - Purchase date, PO number, and expiry/warranty date

  Role-based access means:
    - Lab Technician sees only their lab's assets
    - HOD sees all assets in their department
    - Principal / Admin sees all assets across all departments and buildings
    - IQAC Coordinator gets a full cross-department view for reporting

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE COLLEGE:
  For the first time, the Principal can open a single screen and see:
  "We have 1,247 active assets across 14 departments."
  HODs can see their department's full asset list without relying on a
  technician's personal notebook.
  Finance can export an asset register for audit purposes in seconds.

SETUP GUIDE FOR TEAM:
  Step 1: Create Properties — one for each campus block
          (Example: Block A - Main Building, Block B - Labs Wing,
           Admin Block, Hostel)
  Step 2: Create Departments — one per lab or department
          (Example: CSE Lab 1, CSE Lab 2, Mechanical Workshop, ECE Lab,
           Library, Admin Office)
  Step 3: Add Item Types — Computer, Furniture, Lab Equipment,
          Network Device, Projector, AC Unit, etc.
  Step 4: Bulk Import existing assets via CSV if the college has a
          prior Excel register (use the Bulk Import feature)
  Step 5: For new installs, do a physical walkthrough with the lab
          technician and add assets one-by-one using mobile

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM 2 SOLVED: "Our annual stock verification is a nightmare."
FEATURE: Audit Sessions + QR Scan Verification + PDF Audit Reports
------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW IT WORKS:
  ADMIN STARTS AN AUDIT SESSION:
    The admin (Principal's Office or IQAC Coordinator) starts an Audit
    Session in Folonite Track. This creates an active audit window across
    the entire college or a specific building.

  DEPARTMENTS GET ASSIGNED:
    Each department (lab) is assigned to the relevant lab technician
    or HOD. They receive their assignment within the system.

  STAFF VERIFY ASSETS USING QR CODES:
    Every asset has a printed QR sticker (generated and printed from the
    QR Codes page). The lab technician:
      - Opens Folonite Track on their phone
      - Goes to the Audit page
      - Scans each QR code in the lab
      - Marks each item: Verified / Missing / Damaged
      - Adds a comment if needed (e.g., "screen cracked")
    This happens in real-time, from any mobile device.

  ADMIN MONITORS PROGRESS LIVE:
    While the audit is running, the admin sees a live dashboard:
      - How many departments have submitted
      - How many assets verified vs. missing vs. damaged
      - Per-department progress rings
    No need to chase HODs manually.

  AUDIT REPORT GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY:
    When the admin ends the session, Folonite Track generates a
    structured audit report:
      - Summary: X verified, Y missing, Z damaged
      - Department-by-department breakdown
      - Asset-level detail with status and comments
      - Exported as a print-ready PDF with college branding elements,
        auditor name, date/time, and session name
    This is exactly what NAAC inspectors and internal auditors need.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE COLLEGE:
  Annual stock verification drops from 3 weeks of paper chaos to
  2-3 days of structured digital verification.
  The IQAC coordinator gets a ready-to-submit report. Period.

SETUP GUIDE FOR TEAM:
  Step 1: Before onboarding, confirm all assets are registered in the system
  Step 2: Print QR stickers for all assets (use the QR Codes page,
          bulk print as A4 sheet or individual labels)
  Step 3: Physically stick QR labels on every asset
          (ideally done by lab technicians themselves during onboarding)
  Step 4: Create user accounts for all lab technicians and HODs
  Step 5: Assign departments to users (department-level access)
  Step 6: Train lab technicians on QR scanning (30-minute walkthrough)
  Step 7: Run a test audit — start a session, each person scans 5 items,
          confirm admin sees live progress, generate the test report
  Step 8: College is ready for their first real audit cycle

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM 3 SOLVED: "Equipment breaks and nobody fixes it on time."
FEATURE: Maintenance Tickets + Priority + SLA Tracking + Assignee Management
------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW IT WORKS:
  Anyone in the system can raise a Maintenance Ticket:
    - Title: "Oscilloscope in ECE Lab 2 not powering on"
    - Description: detailed notes on the issue
    - Priority: Low / Medium / High / Urgent
    - Property and assignee selected

  The assigned person (lab assistant, in-house technician, or admin) gets
  the ticket and is responsible for resolution.

  Ticket workflow:
    - Open → In Progress → Resolved → Closed
  
  The admin can monitor:
    - All open tickets across all departments
    - Average resolution time
    - Completion rate
    - Overdue tickets (SLA breach shown in red)
    - Tickets by priority (charts)
    - Monthly trend of new vs. resolved tickets

  Ticket comments allow back-and-forth between the reporter and assignee
  without switching to WhatsApp or email.

  For AMC-managed equipment:
    - The asset entry stores AMC Start Date and AMC End Date
    - Tickets can be raised when the vendor needs to be called for AMC service
    - The system shows "Expiring Soon" status for assets near AMC expiry
    - Admin gets a warning before the AMC lapses

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE COLLEGE:
  No more fixing equipment on WhatsApp with no record.
  Every maintenance request is documented, tracked, and resolved within
  a defined timeframe.
  Finance can see total maintenance requests per term for budgeting.
  HODs can see exactly how long their lab equipment stays broken on average.

SETUP GUIDE FOR TEAM:
  Step 1: Identify the college's internal maintenance person (electrician,
          plumber, or in-house IT technician) — create their account
  Step 2: For AMC vendors, the admin manages tickets on their behalf
  Step 3: Configure priorities: set "Urgent" for equipment that blocks labs,
          "High" for equipment used daily, "Medium/Low" for non-critical items
  Step 4: Ask the admin to review open tickets every Monday morning
          — build this into their workflow

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM 4 SOLVED: "NAAC is coming and we are not ready."
FEATURE: Reports + Audit History + PDF Exports + Multi-session History
------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW IT WORKS:
  Folonite Track maintains a full audit history — every session that was
  conducted, when it happened, who participated, what was found.

  The Reports page provides:
    - Asset inventory summary (count by type, department, property)
    - Asset status breakdown (Active, Under Maintenance, Expiring Soon)
    - Audit session history with downloadable PDFs for each session
    - Maintenance ticket analytics (open, resolved, average resolution time)

  For NAAC:
  The IQAC coordinator can access historical audit reports (all sessions),
  export them as PDFs, and submit them as documentary evidence under
  Criterion 4 (Infrastructure and Learning Resources).

  They can also export the master asset register to show total assets,
  value, department-wise breakdown — directly aligning with NAAC's
  requirements for asset documentation.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE COLLEGE:
  When the NAAC inspector asks: "Show us your stock verification records
  for the past 2 years" — the IQAC coordinator opens Folonite Track,
  selects the relevant audit sessions, downloads 2 formatted PDFs, and
  hands them over.
  That's it.

SETUP GUIDE FOR TEAM:
  Step 1: For colleges preparing for NAAC, onboard them at minimum
          3 months before their scheduled assessment.
  Step 2: Run at least one full audit cycle before the NAAC visit
          so they have at least one documented audit report.
  Step 3: Help them print and organize the PDF reports in their
          NAAC documentation folder (physical + digital).
  Step 4: Advise them: conduct an audit every term (twice a year) for
          ongoing NAAC compliance — this becomes your retention hook.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM 5 SOLVED: "Equipment goes missing and no one is accountable."
FEATURE: QR Code Tracking + Audit Trail + Department Scoping + Activity Log
------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW IT WORKS:
  Every asset has a unique QR sticker permanently attached to it.
  The QR code links to that exact asset's profile in Folonite Track.
  Any team member can scan the QR code and see:
    - What the asset is
    - Which department it belongs to
    - Its current status
    - Its full audit history (was it verified in the last audit? When?)

  During audit, if an asset is found in the WRONG department,
  it's flagged as a discrepancy. The admin sees the mismatch.

  The Activity Log records who created, modified, or deleted any asset.
  Admin-level users can see: "Asset ECE002 was last updated by John (Lab Tech)
  on 14-Feb-2026 at 3:45 PM."

  The Approval Workflow adds another layer:
  Non-admin users cannot delete or significantly edit an asset without
  manager/admin approval. Every change goes through a documented approval
  chain. No silent deletions.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE COLLEGE:
  High-value portable equipment (laptops, robotic kits, oscilloscopes)
  can be tracked to its last known verified location.
  If an asset goes missing, there is a clear record of its last audit
  verification — narrowing down accountability significantly.
  The approval workflow prevents staff from "deleting" assets that are
  actually just misplaced.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM 6 SOLVED: "We have multiple buildings and no visibility."
FEATURE: Multi-Property Management + Property-Scoped Access
------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW IT WORKS:
  Each campus building or block is set up as a "Property" in Folonite Track.
  Examples:
    - Property: Block A — Main Academic Block
    - Property: Block B — Labs and Workshops
    - Property: Block C — New Extension Building
    - Property: Admin Block
    - Property: Library Building

  Assets are assigned to their Property (building) AND Department (lab/room).
  Users are assigned access to specific Properties — a lab technician in
  Block B only sees Block B's assets, not Block A's.

  The admin/Principal sees ALL properties in one unified dashboard.
  They can filter the asset list by Property to get a per-building view.
  Audit sessions can be scoped to a specific property so that only
  Block B runs an audit while Block A is separate.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE COLLEGE:
  A multi-campus or multi-block college gets ONE unified system with
  clear separation between locations.
  The admin controls who sees what — a lab tech in Mechanical Workshop
  cannot accidentally edit assets in CSE Lab.

================================================================================
PART 3: DECISION MAKER MAP
================================================================================

Understanding WHO you are talking to at a college is critical.
Different roles have different pain points and should be pitched differently.

ROLE 1: PRINCIPAL / DIRECTOR
  Pain: Accountability, reputation, NAAC grades, NIRF ranking
  What they care about: Does this make NAAC easier? Does it bring order?
  How to approach: Lead with NAAC compliance and institutional accountability.
  Say: "This gives you a complete, verified asset record that your IQAC team
       can submit directly for NAAC documentation. It replaces 4 weeks of
       manual stock verification with 2 days of digital audit."
  Decision Authority: FINAL sign-off. They say yes, it happens.

ROLE 2: IQAC COORDINATOR / NAAC IN-CHARGE
  Pain: Data collection from HODs, inconsistent Excel files, NAAC documentation
  What they care about: Documentation quality, audit reports, inspection readiness
  How to approach: This is your CHAMPION. Win this person and the deal is done.
  Say: "We generate the exact stock verification report you need for Criterion 4.
       One click. PDF. Done. Every HOD submits their department digitally."
  Decision Authority: Strong influencer. Champion who takes it to the Principal.

ROLE 3: HOD (HEAD OF DEPARTMENT)
  Pain: Lab management, equipment downtime, accountability of lab staff
  What they care about: Less time spent on paperwork, functional equipment
  How to approach: Show them the department view — their assets, their audit,
                   their maintenance tickets — all in one place.
  Say: "Instead of sending your lab technician to fill paper registers,
       they scan QR codes on their phone. You see the result in real-time."
  Decision Authority: Operational buy-in. Their resistance = no adoption.
                      Their enthusiasm = smooth rollout.

ROLE 4: LAB TECHNICIAN / LAB ASSISTANT
  Pain: Manual record-keeping, no accountability when things go wrong,
        taking blame for missing equipment they didn't lose
  What they care about: Simple tools, not more paperwork
  How to approach: QR scan demo. Show them: one scan = asset verified.
                   That's it. No forms to fill.
  Say: "Your audit used to take 2 weeks of writing. Now it's 2 days of scanning."
  Decision Authority: User. Adoption depends on their comfort level.
                      Demo must be simple and fast.

ROLE 5: FINANCE / ACCOUNTS OFFICER
  Pain: Asset register maintenance for auditors, AMC budget tracking,
        proof of asset purchase for government audits
  What they care about: Financial asset records, AMC expiry alerts, export capability
  How to approach: Show the PO number field, AMC dates, expiry tracking,
                   and the ability to export the full asset register.
  Say: "Every asset has its PO number, purchase date, and AMC dates stored.
       When your CA asks for the asset register, you export it in seconds."
  Decision Authority: Budget gatekeeper. Their approval speeds procurement.

================================================================================
PART 4: LEAD GENERATION — WHERE TO FIND THEM
================================================================================

PRIMARY CHANNELS:

1. COLLEGE WEBSITES (DIRECT)
   - Every college lists their Principal's contact and IQAC cell contact
     publicly because NAAC mandates it.
   - Go to college website → "About Us" or "IQAC" section
   - You will find the IQAC Coordinator's name, email, and sometimes
     phone number.
   - This is your highest-priority lead source. These contacts are
     decision-makers, not gatekeepers.

2. AICTE COLLEGE PORTAL
   - AICTE website lists all approved engineering colleges with state,
     district, and contact information.
   - You can filter by state/city and build a targeted lead list.
   - Website: https://facilities.aicte-india.org/dashboard/pages/angulardashboard.php

3. LINKEDIN
   - Search: "IQAC Coordinator" + [City Name]
   - Search: "NAAC Coordinator engineering college"
   - Search: "Principal engineering college" + [City Name]
   - These professionals are often active on LinkedIn.
   - Connect with a note: "I help engineering colleges prepare for NAAC stock
     verification audits. I'd love to show you a quick demo."

4. NAAC-RELATED EVENTS AND WORKSHOPS
   - NAAC conducts orientation workshops for colleges preparing for assessment.
   - State-level IQAC meets are common — attend or sponsor.
   - These are rooms full of your ideal champions.

5. ENGINEERING COLLEGE ASSOCIATIONS
   - Each state has an Association of Private Engineering Colleges
     (e.g., APECEA in Andhra Pradesh, TANCA in Tamil Nadu).
   - A single tie-up with an association can get you introductions to
     100+ colleges at once.

6. REFERRALS FROM PILOT CUSTOMERS
   - IQAC coordinators attend state-level NAAC preparation meetings.
   - A happy customer's word-of-mouth to 2-3 colleges is your fastest
     growth channel once you have 3-5 live clients.


WHAT TO AVOID:
  - Cold calling reception desks — they cannot connect you to IQAC.
  - Emailing generic "info@college.edu" — zero response rate.
  - Targeting colleges that just completed NAAC assessment (they won't
    pay for 5 years until the next cycle approaches).
  - Targeting colleges under government control — procurement takes 6-12
    months through committee approvals.

PRIORITY TARGETING:
  Best targets are colleges that:
  (a) Are 18-24 months away from NAAC re-assessment, OR
  (b) Are applying for NAAC accreditation for the first time, OR
  (c) Recently got a lower grade and are working to improve, OR
  (d) Have recently had a government audit that exposed asset record gaps

================================================================================
PART 5: THE SALES CONVERSATION
================================================================================

COLD EMAIL TEMPLATE (for IQAC Coordinator):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NAAC stock verification in 2 days, not 3 weeks

Hi [Name],

I know IQAC coordinators spend weeks preparing stock verification records
every year for NAAC documentation — collecting Excel files from HODs,
reconciling discrepancies, compiling a master register.

We built Folonite Track specifically to fix this. With QR-coded asset labels
and digital audit sessions, your staff scan assets on their phones,
and you get a formatted PDF report ready for NAAC submission.

No more paper registers. No more chasing HODs. No more last-minute scrambling.

I'd love to show you a 15-minute demo at your convenience.
Are you available this week or next?

[Your Name]
Folonite Track | folonite.in
--------------------------------------------------------------------


OPENING QUESTIONS (to understand their situation):
  - "How do you currently track your lab assets and equipment?"
  - "When was your last NAAC assessment and when is the next one?"
  - "How long does your annual stock verification take?"
  - "Do you have someone dedicated to maintaining an asset register?"
  - "What happens when equipment breaks in a lab — what's the process?"

DISCOVERY RED FLAGS (these are BIG signals — lean in):
  - "We still use Excel / paper registers" → Perfect prospect
  - "Our last NAAC visit was rough on Infrastructure" → Urgent prospect
  - "We are preparing for NAAC next year" → Hot prospect
  - "Lab equipment goes missing and we don't know where" → Immediate pain
  - "Our HODs submit stock records at the last minute" → Audit pain

THE DEMO FLOW (15-20 minutes — stick to this sequence):
  1. Show the Asset Registry: "This is your entire college in one view.
     Every asset, every department, every building."
  2. Show Property + Department structure: "Block A is here, Block B here.
     CSE Lab 1, ECE Lab 2 — all separate, all visible together."
  3. Open the QR Code page: "Each asset gets this QR label. Printed and
     stuck to the equipment. Takes 1 minute per lab."
  4. LIVE DEMO — QR Scan on phone: Open Folonite on mobile, scan a QR code
     on any nearby object (for demo purposes), show it resolving to an asset.
     Say: "Your lab technician does this for every item. Takes 2 days."
  5. Show the Audit page — admin view: Progress rings per department,
     verified/missing/damaged counts updating live.
  6. Generate the PDF: "This is what your IQAC coordinator submits to NAAC."
  7. Show Maintenance Tickets: "Lab equipment breakdown? Ticket raised here.
     Assigned, tracked, resolved. No more WhatsApp chasing."
  8. Ask: "How much time do you currently spend on stock verification
     each year? What would 2 days instead of 3 weeks mean to your team?"


HANDLING COMMON OBJECTIONS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECTION: "We already have an ERP that handles this."
RESPONSE:  "Most college ERPs have a basic asset module — a glorified
           spreadsheet. Does yours let lab technicians scan QR codes from
           their phones and submit audit results in real-time? Does it
           generate a NAAC-formatted stock verification report?
           If yes, great. If not, we fill exactly that gap."

OBJECTION: "Our staff won't use new software — they're not tech-savvy."
RESPONSE:  "The lab technician's job is simple: open the app, point camera,
           scan, mark verified. That's it. We've designed this specifically
           for non-tech users. If they can use WhatsApp, they can use this."

OBJECTION: "We don't have the budget for this."
RESPONSE:  "At ₹5,000 a month, this is the cost of 2-3 days of admin staff
           time. You're currently spending 3 weeks of multiple staff members
           on stock verification. Folonite cuts that to 2 days. The ROI is
           immediate and measurable."

OBJECTION: "Let's wait until after NAAC."
RESPONSE:  "That's exactly when your next preparation begins. Colleges that
           set up Folonite now do their audit mid-year, have records ready
           by the time assessment approaches. The ones who wait start
           scrambling again. When is your next NAAC cycle?"

OBJECTION: "How long does setup take?"
RESPONSE:  "We do a guided onboarding. Week 1: system setup and data entry.
           Week 2: print QR labels and stick them. Week 3: first test audit.
           You are production-ready within 3 weeks."

================================================================================
PART 6: ONBOARDING PLAYBOOK
================================================================================

STEP 1 — PRE-ONBOARDING CALL (Day 0)
  Participants: Your team + IQAC Coordinator + IT admin (if any)
  Agenda:
    - Understand campus structure (number of blocks, departments, labs)
    - Understand current asset tracking method (Excel/paper/nothing)
    - Get a rough count of total assets if available
    - Agree on a go-live timeline
    - Share the Folonite Track login credentials

STEP 2 — SYSTEM SETUP (Days 1–3)
  Your team or the college admin does this:
    - Create Properties: one per campus block/building
    - Create Departments: one per lab, department, or area
    - Create Item Types: Computer, Projector, Lab Equipment, Furniture, etc.
    - Create User accounts for all staff who will use the system:
        * Admin (Principal's office / IQAC Coordinator — full access)
        * Manager (HODs — department-level management)
        * User (Lab Technicians — audit and ticket submission only)

STEP 3 — DATA ENTRY / ASSET IMPORT (Days 3–7)
  Option A (Recommended): Bulk CSV Import
    - If the college has any existing Excel register, export it as CSV
    - Map columns to Folonite Track's asset fields
    - Import using the Bulk Import feature
    - Clean up any duplicates or missing data after import

  Option B: Fresh Entry During Physical Walkthrough
    - Walk each lab with the lab technician
    - Add assets one by one using mobile or desktop
    - This doubles as a "discovery audit" — you find unlisted assets

  Target: All assets for at least 3-4 key departments registered before
          moving to the next step.

STEP 4 — QR LABEL PRINTING AND STICKING (Days 5–10)
  - Go to the QR Codes page in Folonite Track
  - Select assets and print QR labels (A4 sheet grid or individual labels)
  - For label printing, use standard A4 sticker sheets (available at any
    stationery shop for ₹5–₹10 per sheet)
  - Physical labeling: lab technicians paste labels on each asset
  - Recommendations:
      * Laptops/computers: inside the lid or bottom panel
      * Lab equipment: side panel or back face
      * Furniture: underside of desk or chair leg
      * Projectors: base or cable port area

STEP 5 — USER TRAINING (Day 7–10)
  Two separate sessions:

  Session A: Admin / IQAC Coordinator (60 minutes)
    - Creating and managing audit sessions
    - Viewing live audit progress
    - Generating and exporting PDF reports
    - Managing user accounts and permissions
    - Viewing the Reports page
    - Raising and managing maintenance tickets

  Session B: Lab Technicians / HODs (30 minutes)
    - Logging in on mobile
    - Navigating to the Audit page
    - Selecting their department
    - Scanning QR codes with the phone camera
    - Marking assets as Verified / Damaged / Missing
    - Submitting their department audit
    - Raising a maintenance ticket

STEP 6 — FIRST LIVE AUDIT (Day 10–14)
  - Admin starts an Audit Session
  - Each department lead runs their QR scan in their assigned area
  - Admin monitors live progress
  - Session ends, report is generated
  - Review the report together with the IQAC coordinator
  - Note any discrepancies and resolve them (missing assets tracked down,
    damaged assets ticketed for maintenance)

STEP 7 — POST-ONBOARDING REVIEW (Day 30)
  Check in after 30 days:
    - Are all lab technicians actively using the system?
    - Have any maintenance tickets been raised and resolved?
    - Are there any new assets to add?
    - Is the IQAC coordinator comfortable generating reports?
    - Schedule the next audit session (recommend quarterly)

PART 7: PRICING FOR THIS ICP
================================================================================

RECOMMENDED PRICING STRUCTURE:

STARTER PLAN — ₹5,000/month
  Best for: Small college, 1 block/campus, up to 500 assets, up to 10 users
  Includes: Full asset registry, QR codes, audits, tickets, reports

GROWTH PLAN — ₹10,000/month
  Best for: Mid-sized college, 2-3 blocks, up to 2,000 assets, up to 30 users
  Includes: Everything in Starter + multi-property management, advanced reports

ENTERPRISE PLAN — ₹20,000+/month
  Best for: Large college group (multiple campuses), 5,000+ assets, 50+ users
  Includes: Everything in Growth + dedicated onboarding support, SLA

ONE-TIME ONBOARDING FEE: ₹30,000 – ₹60,000
  Covers: System setup, data migration, QR label printing assistance,
          user training (2 sessions), and 30-day post-launch support.
  This is MANDATORY for new clients — it ensures proper adoption.

ANNUAL BILLING DISCOUNT: Offer 10-15% discount for annual upfront payment.
  Many colleges prefer annual payments aligned with their academic year budget.
  This also reduces your churn risk.

ROI FRAMING FOR THE PROSPECT:
  - 3 weeks of annual stock verification = ~15 staff-days × ₹1,000/day
    = ₹15,000 of staff time per year, MINIMUM.
  - Folonite Track costs ₹5,000/month = ₹60,000/year.
  - But it saves not just time — it saves NAAC grade points, prevents
    asset loss (₹5–₹50 lakhs per year for an average college),
    and eliminates missed AMC renewals (which cost ₹50,000+ per incident).
  - Frame it: "Your AMC for one lab's equipment costs more than a year
    of Folonite Track."

================================================================================
PART 8: SUCCESS METRICS — HOW TO MEASURE WIN
================================================================================

After onboarding a college, track these metrics to measure success:

  Onboarding Completion Rate:
    - % of assets imported into the system within 30 days
    - % of assets with QR labels physically applied
    - Target: 90% within 30 days

  Audit Adoption:
    - Number of audit sessions conducted within first 3 months
    - Target: At least 1 full college-wide audit in first 60 days

  Active Users:
    - Number of users logging in at least once per week
    - Target: All lab technicians using the system during audit cycles

  Ticket Resolution:
    - Average time from ticket creation to resolution
    - Track if it improves month over month

  Renewal Trigger:
    - Create calendar reminder for 60 days before NAAC assessment
    - Proactively contact the IQAC coordinator to prepare audit reports
    - This is your strongest retention and upsell moment
